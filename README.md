I'm currently following a fulltime BSc programme in Computing Science at the University of Groningen (NL). For public university projects refer to [@FoxSamuUni](https://github.com/FoxSamuUni).

I do a lot with front-end stuff and designs. I help at [Reffurence](https://reffurence.com/) with the design of the website and other (printed and digital) media.
