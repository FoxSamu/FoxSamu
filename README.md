## Note about my website domain
I am switching from shadew.net to runefox.dev. Both will work for now but please use the latter as I may shut down the former sooner or later. I'm still reconfiguring services:
- [x] Website (moved: runefox.dev)
- [ ] Maven repo (not yet moved: maven.shadew.net)

# Check out my projects:
