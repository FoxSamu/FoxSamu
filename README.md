# Hellu!

Hi I'm Samū. I do things. Like programming! This GitHub is my personal account where I publish all the random things that I make.

- My brain runs fox software
- 22 years old
- He/Him
- Hobbyist programmer & graphical designer
- I speak English & Dutch, learning German & Finnish (älä kysy minulta miksi)
- Over 10 years experience in programming
- Interested in deranged stuff that nobody else likes to do (math)
- Kotlin - Java - Rust - TypeScript - JavaScript - C - Python
- I prefer British English over other forms of English, even in code (yes `val colour: Color` is an actual statement made by me in actual code)

I deploy some Java/Kotlin libraries on https://maven.runefox.dev/ sometimes.

I'm currently studying a BSc Computing Science at the University of Groningen. Previous education includes an exchange to the University of Helsinki as part of my current studies, and a never-finished BSc Technical Computer Science at the University of Twente. For public university projects refer to [@FoxSamuUni](https://github.com/FoxSamuUni).

I volunteer for [Stichting Reffurence](https://reffurence.com/about), where I am Head of Design and coordinate anything design related, including UI and UX.
